# Weather App

The Weather App is a simple web application that allows users to check the current temperature and view weather information for a specified city. This project is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any external frameworks or libraries.

## Features

- **Current Temperature**: View the current temperature in Celsius for a specified city.
- **Dynamic Background Color**: The background color changes based on the temperature range (cold, moderate, hot).
- **Error Handling**: Alerts users if the city is not found or if there's an error fetching weather data.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the web page and defining its content.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the user interface and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Used for fetching weather data from an API, handling user interactions, and updating the UI dynamically.

## Usage

1. Enter the name of a city in the `<input>` field.
2. Click the "Submit" button to fetch weather information for the specified city.
3. The current temperature for the city will be displayed along with a dynamically changing background color.
